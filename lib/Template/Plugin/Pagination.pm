=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::Pagination - a plugin to help paginate pages of results

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [% USE page = Pagination(items, current_page, entries_per_page) %]

	[% FOREACH item IN page.page_data; ...; DONE %]

  First page: [% page.first_page %]
  Prev page: [% page.previous_page %]
  Next page: [% page.next_page %]
  Last page: [% page.last_page %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin helps you construct pages that include subsets of data from
a list, such as search results which you'll paginated in groups of 10.

It's based heavily on Template::Plugin::Page, which you should see for a
detailed example of to use this. (That module is a thin wrapper around
Data::Page, whereas this one is a wrapper around Data::Paginated, which
is Data::Page + Data::Pageset + some extras).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Pagination

This is the constructor. It has one mandatory arguments: the list of items
we're working with. You can also pass the page number you're currently
working with which will otherwise default to 1) and the number of entries
there will be on each page (which defaults to 10).

sub new {
  my ($proto, $context, $list, $current, $per_page) = @_;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  ($list, $per_page, $current) = ($context, $list, $per_page)
    unless ref($context) eq 'Template::Context';

  return Data::Paginated->new({
    entries => $list,
    entries_per_page => $per_page || 10,
    current_page => $current || 1,
	});
}
